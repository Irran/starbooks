How can computers automatically improve performance as experience accumulates? This is the purpose of machine learning. This book shows the core algorithms and theories in machine learning and explains the running process of the algorithm. This book synthesizes many research results, such as statistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, information theory, biology, cognitive science, computational complexity, and cybernetics, to understand the background, algorithms, and implicit assumptions of the problem.
