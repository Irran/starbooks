Dear reader: at this moment, you hold this book in your hand, wondering if it is worth reading ... "Happy to die" is the name of this book, it also saved my life to some extent. My grandmother used to say: "Life is hard, hard, bad, and all kinds of nonsense. "-The last half of the sentence is my interpretation. She's right. Each of us has our share of disaster, madness, or drama, but the different ways we treat these terrible things will make a difference. Whenever I look at my life, I see signs of high water levels of happiness, and I see valleys -- I have to convince myself that suicide is not the solution. In between, I see my life. I see the sadness and misery of life making happiness and ecstasy sweeter. I see every inch of my soul, every inch of my horrible depression, and it gives me more room to grow and enjoy the rest.
