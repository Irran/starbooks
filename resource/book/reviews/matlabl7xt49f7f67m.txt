(1) The author compiles that the quality of books is more guaranteed: first-line engineers write and systematically summarize and summarize the actual experience of intelligent algorithms. (2) Provide supporting source code, easy for readers to practice: theory must be linked to practice, this book provides source code download, easy for readers to learn and use. (3) Rich examples are included to facilitate readers 'secondary development: The book provides a typical example of a dozen signal processing algorithms that readers can develop twice. The matching learning resource download address is the page of Tsinghua University Press website book. The series of best-selling books are as follows: MATLAB Programming Guide-Computing, Programming, Simulation, Algorithm and Application MATLAB/Simulink System Simulation MATLAB GUI Programming MATLAB Intelligent Algorithm MATLAB Mathematical Modeling MATLAB Scientific Computing MATLAB Signal Processing MATLAB Image Processing MATLAB Optimization Algorithm
