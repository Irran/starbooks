This book is a continuation of the "TCP/IP Detailed Solution Series." The main contents include: TCP transaction protocol, that is, T/TCP, which is an extension of TCP, making client-server transactions faster, more efficient and more reliable; TCP/IP applications, mainly HTTP and NNTP; UNIX domain agreements, which provide a means of communication between processes. When the customer and server processes are on the same host, the UNIX domain protocol is usually twice as fast as TCP/IP. This book also uses a large number of examples and implementation details, and references a large number of source programs in Volume 2. For people who want to understand how TCP/IP works, including programmers who write network applications and system administrators who use TCP/IP to maintain computer networks.
