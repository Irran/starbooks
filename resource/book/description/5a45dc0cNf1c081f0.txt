This is an amazing and special novel. The author of the novel is both highly sensitive and a close witness, so that the whole thing is preserved like a "surviving specimen." The whole book is reversed, and with an extremely close perspective on the victim, it is direct to the pain of "someone else taking away something precious from you" -- and the predatory person is happy with it.
