This book shows the core algorithms and theories in machine learning and explains the running process of the algorithm. This book synthesizes many research results, such as statistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, information theory, biology, cognitive science, computational complexity, and cybernetics, to understand the background, algorithms, and implicit assumptions of the problem. This book can be used as a teaching material for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science. It can also be used as a reference book for researchers and teachers in related fields.
