In the book on algorithms, some of the narratives are very rigorous, but they are not comprehensive enough; Others involve a large number of subjects but lack rigour. This book integrates rigour and comprehensiveness, discusses various algorithms in depth, and strives to make the design and analysis of these algorithms acceptable to readers at all levels. Each chapter of the book is self-contained and can be used as an independent learning unit; The algorithm is described in English and pseudo-code, and people with initial programming experience can understand it; The explanations and explanations are simple and easy to understand, without losing depth and mathematical rigour.
