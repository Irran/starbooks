In the game of finite and infinite: the competitive world in the eyes of a philosopher, Cass shows us two types of "games" in life: "limited games" and "infinite games." Limited games, whose purpose is to win; The infinite game is designed to keep the game going forever. Limited games play within the boundary, and unlimited games play the boundary. Limited games have a definite start and end, with a specific winner. The rule exists to ensure that the game will end. The infinite game advocates "playing for the game." Here, the rules must ensure the infinity of the game, so the rules are variable. Perhaps the most appropriate example is "life."
