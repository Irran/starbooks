This book is a textbook written for the "data structure" course and can also be used as a reference material for learning data structure and its algorithm C programming. The first half of this book discusses the basic data structures and their applications from the perspective of abstract data types; The latter part mainly discusses the various implementation methods of search and sorting and their comprehensive analysis and comparison. Its content and chapter layout are basically consistent with the "Data Structure"(second edition) published in April 1992, but the concept of abstract data types is more prominent in this book. The book uses the C-like language as a description language for data structures and algorithms. The concept of this book is rigorous, logical reasoning is strict, the language is refined, the words are used, and there is a supporting publication of the "Data Structure Collection"(C language version), which is not only easy to teach but also easy to self-study. This book can be used as a undergraduate or specialist teaching material for computer majors or information related majors. It can also be used as a reference for science and technology workers engaged in computer engineering and application work.
